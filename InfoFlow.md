## Information Flow
This is a quick attempt to capture some input and outputs of my digital life.

### Main Tools
1. Feedly (RSS feeds)
2. Hacker News (tech news/novelty)  
3. Artifact News (general news, curated, (app is going away)[https://medium.com/artifact-news/shutting-down-artifact-1e70de46d419])  
4. Twitter (trying to exit but lots of journalism/breaking news is still there)
5. Instagram (increased in usefulness after many folks left Twitter; sometimes a huge timesuck)
6. Mastodon (post-Twitter home...but still not at critical mass to be a good information source)
7. Omnivore (read-it-later app; moved here from Pocket because Omnivore is FOSS)
8. Logseq (this is my note taking and to-do app; it takes a while to get used to but worth the effort; no native remote sync between mobile and remote data (e.g. OneDrive/Nextcloud/Google Drive)  
9. Email (yeah, some sources still send email newsletters)
