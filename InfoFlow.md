## Information Flow
This is a quick attempt to capture some input and outputs of my digital life.

### Main Tools
1. Feedly (RSS feeds)
2. Hacker News (tech news/novelty)  
3. Artifact News (general news, curated, [app is going away](https://medium.com/artifact-news/shutting-down-artifact-1e70de46d419))  
4. Twitter (trying to exit but lots of journalism/breaking news is still there)
5. Instagram (increased in usefulness after many folks left Twitter; sometimes a huge timesuck)
6. Mastodon (post-Twitter home...but still not at critical mass to be a good information source)
7. Omnivore (read-it-later app; moved here from Pocket because Omnivore is FOSS)
8. Logseq (this is my note taking and to-do app; it takes a while to get used to but worth the effort; no native remote sync between mobile and remote data (e.g. OneDrive/Nextcloud/Google Drive)  
9. Email (yeah, some sources still send email newsletters)  
### Process (daily)
1. Feedly gets 20-30 minutes. It is set to display last 2 days of feeds; there are <20 feeds. If there's something that looks interesting, the blurb gets a quick read; if the blurb is good enough, then the article goes to Omnivore.
2. Hacker News gets a 20 minute scan. If something looks interesting there, it goes into Omnivore.
3. Artifact gets 30 minutes due to the various categories of news. Here I'll often use Buffer to post to social media. If the news piece is important, it goes to Omnivore.
4. Twitter/Instagram...this is a huge time suck because the algorithm really encourages time-wasting. I try to do about 15-20 minute slots but I should measure how much time I actually spend...it's likely frightening.
5. Mastodon gets about 20-30 minutes. Because it doesn't have the algorithms rigged to suck time, it's easier to not engage as heavily.
6. Omnivore generally gets a slotted hour because it's where I'll do deep reading and where things helpful to comrades usually ends up first. I installed a plug-in that sends my highlights to Logseq. I'm also big about deleting things, often from Hacker News, that seemed interesting but upon closer reading aren't that important. This curation is mostly so that I have better search results.
7. Logseq is almost always open. I want to be better about using it to journal but, over the last 2 years of use, it's mostly where tasks and notes are captured. On mobile, I tend to use Simple Note and then pull important things into Logseq manually. I moved to Logseq from Joplin because Logseq saves notes in Markdown so I know I can access them anywhere...downside is that I wouldn't call it a "secure" notes app. Additionally, sometimes folks seem to have sync issues.
### Not Captured  
1. Old school books...I love books. I use a Kindle but that's somewhat reluctantly since paper is an important part of reading to me. A challenge with the Kindle is that it's good about capturing notes in Amazon books (MOBI) but not EPUB. This means there's no good way to get at all the highlights I make. One potential work-around could be using Calibre to convert the EPUB to MOBI but that's more work...and it means supporting the Amazon DRM ecosystem. Sigh.
2. Podcasts deserver a mention not because I listen to lots of them but because the few that I've listened to aren't saved anywhere. Also, I'm not sure how I'd share knowledge gleaned from them unless I were single-taksed during a podcast...unfortunately I'm often listening in the background of a foregrounded task.
