## Historical Context
* NGO's with web sites
* NGO's with social media
* NGO's with crypto-currency

## AI 
* Highly automated guessing
* Builds on machine learning, artificial intelligence, predictive texting, predictive search

## Elements
* High compute which is harmful for the planet
* Exploitative labor practices towards the classifiers
* Hoovering intellectual property w/o regard to licensing
* Expropriation of language; what is an "open source" LLM/data set?
* Hype, so much hype

## Risks
* All bright and shiny tech...
* Loss of functional skills (e.g. formulas only by MS Copilot w/o any checking)
* Hallucinations (e.g. a whole body of knowledge being build called "prompt engineering" just to coax the correct/accurate answer from LLMs)
* Built-in bias ("educated" CIS male english speakers) 
* Sustainability: economically for subscribers (and vendors/no clear profit model); ecologically for the planet
* Unclear what is happening to "upstream" data and how it's anonomized...*or not*
* Misuse/absence of regulations
