## Historical Context
* NGO's with web sites
* NGO's with social media
* NGO's with crypto-currency
* NGO's with machine translation/transcription

## AI 
* Highly automated guessing
* Builds on machine learning, artificial intelligence, predictive texting, predictive search

## Elements
* Extractive to its core
* High compute which is harmful for the planet
* Exploitative labor practices towards the classifiers
* Hoovering intellectual property w/o regard to licensing
* Expropriation of language; what is an "open source" LLM/data set?
* Hype, so much hype

## Potentially Helpful Use Case Scenarios
* Document summaries (though it will miss notes/footnotes)
* Transcription (in english)
* Indigenous language preservation
* Cybersecurity & forensic accounting (finding deviations from patterns)
* Flagging disinformation (with huge limitations) 

## Risks
* All bright and shiny tech...
* Loss of functional skills (e.g. formulas only by MS Copilot w/o any checking)
* Hallucinations (e.g. a whole body of knowledge being build called "prompt engineering" just to coax the correct/accurate answer from LLMs)
* Built-in bias ("educated" CIS male english speakers) 
* Sustainability: economically for subscribers (and vendors/no clear profit model); ecologically for the planet
* Unclear what is happening to "upstream" data and how it's anonomized...*or not*
* Misuse/absence of regulations

## Suggestions
* Use traditional risk managment frameworks when transacting/interacting with data...especially sensitive data
* Rely on existing frameworks, like acceptable use policies, when introducing new technologies
* Create guidance on new technologies before creating a concrete policy...some technology doesn't last (i.e. crypto in the NGO space). Tap communities of practice and user groups w/in your org/formation.
* Nurture a culture of graceful and communicated fails; failing to learn.

## Tools
If you want to play with AI locally, there are some OK options:
1. Ollma can run on your computer: https://ollama.com/
2. Jan.ai is a tidy software package that allows you to download and use LLMs on your computer: https://jan.ai/
